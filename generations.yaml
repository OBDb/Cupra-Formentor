    description: "The Cupra Formentor is the first standalone model developed specifically for SEAT's performance-oriented Cupra sub-brand rather than being derived from an existing SEAT model. Built on Volkswagen Group's MQB Evo platform, it features a distinctive coupe-SUV design with sharp, aggressive styling that emphasizes sportiness over traditional SUV utility. The exterior showcases Cupra's design language with angular lines, a sloping roofline, full-width rear light bar, and signature copper accents. Powertrain options are extensive, ranging from a 150 HP 1.5L TSI to a range-topping 2.5L five-cylinder turbo producing 390 HP in the VZ5 limited edition model. The lineup also includes 2.0L TSI variants with outputs from 190 HP to 310 HP and plug-in hybrid (eHybrid) versions combining a 1.4L TSI engine with an electric motor for a combined output of up to 245 HP and approximately 50 km (31 miles) of electric-only range. Most powerful variants feature 4Drive all-wheel drive, while entry models are front-wheel drive. The interior offers a driver-focused cockpit with a 12-inch infotainment touchscreen, digital instrument cluster, and sports seats with copper stitching. The driving experience emphasizes handling and performance, with features including Dynamic Chassis Control adaptive suspension on higher-end models. The Formentor represents Cupra's positioning as a more emotionally engaging, performance-focused alternative to mainstream brands, blending crossover practicality with sports car influence in both design and driving dynamics."
